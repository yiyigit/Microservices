# Istio
Istio is an open platform service mesh implementation for connecting, managing, and securing microservices. Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more without requiring any changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication among microservices, which is configured and managed using Istio’s control plane functionality.

Istio provides a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications by providing behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole. It provides several key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

- Traffic management: Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
- Observability: Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.
- Policy enforcement: Apply organizational policies to the interaction between services and ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
- Service identity and security: Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustability.

    How Istio works
An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars that mediate and control all network communication among microservices.
The control plane is responsible for managing and configuring proxies to route traffic and enforcing policies at runtime.
The following diagram shows the different components in each plane:

    Sidecar proxy
A service mesh implementation, such as Istio, uses proxies that are usually deployed as sidecars in pods. A proxy controls access to another object. Istio uses proxies between services and clients. It enables the service mesh to manage interactions.

As a point of review, Kubernetes deploys containers into pods and all the containers in a pod are hosted on the same node. A pod can manage the network access to the containers in the pod. A pod typically hosts a single container, but can host multiple pods as a unit.

A sidecar adds behavior to a container without changing it. In that sense, the sidecar and the service behave as a single enhanced unit. The pods host the sidecar and service as a single unit.



    Envoy
Istio uses an extended version of the Envoy proxy, a high-performance proxy developed in C++, to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Istio uses Envoy’s many built-in features such as dynamic service discovery, load balancing, TLS termination, HTTP/2 and gRPC proxying, circuit breakers, health checks, staged rollouts with %-based traffic split, fault injection, and rich metrics.

Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same Kubernetes pod. This allows Istio to extract a wealth of signals about traffic behavior as attributes, which in turn it can use in Mixer to enforce policy decisions and be sent to monitoring systems to provide information about the behavior of the entire mesh. The sidecar proxy model also allows you to add Istio capabilities to an existing deployment with no need to rearchitect or rewrite code. You can read more about why this approach was chosen in Design Goals.

    Mixer
Mixer is a platform-independent component responsible for enforcing access control and usage policies across the service mesh and collecting telemetry data from the Envoy proxy and other services. The proxy extracts request level attributes, which are sent to Mixer for evaluation. For more information on this attribute extraction and policy evaluation, see Mixer Configuration. Mixer includes a flexible plugin model that enables it to interface with a variety of host environments and infrastructure back ends, which abstracts the Envoy proxy and Istio-managed services from these details.

    Pilot
Pilot provides service discovery for the Envoy sidecars, traffic management capabilities for intelligent routing (for example, A/B tests and canary deployments), and resiliency (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, and more). It converts a high-level routing rules that control traffic behavior into Envoy-specific configurations and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime. Pilot abstracts platform-specific service discovery mechanisms and synthesizes them into a standard format consumable by any sidecar that conforms to the Envoy data plane APIs. This loose coupling allows Istio to run on multiple environments (for example, Kubernetes, Consul/Nomad) while maintaining the same operator interface for traffic management.

    Citadel
Citadel (previously called Istio Auth) provides strong service-to-service and end-user authentication using mutual TLS, with built-in identity and credential management. It can be used to upgrade unencrypted traffic in the service mesh and provides operators the ability to enforce policy that is based on service identity rather than network controls. Future releases of Istio will add fine-grained access control and auditing to control and monitor who accesses your service, API, or resource by using a variety of access control mechanisms, including attribute and role-based access control and authorization hooks.
