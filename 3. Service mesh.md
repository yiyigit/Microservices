# Service Mesh
    Definition
a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between microservices, often using a sidecar proxy.
A service mesh, like the open source project Istio, is a way to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. This visible infrastructure layer can document how well (or not) different parts of an app interact, so it becomes easier to optimize communication and avoid downtime as an app grows.

Service-to-service communication is what makes microservices possible. The logic governing communication can be coded into each service without a service mesh layer—but as communication gets more complex, a service mesh becomes more valuable. For cloud-native apps built in a microservices architecture, a service mesh is a way to comprise a large number of discrete services into a functional application.

    How does it work?
A service mesh doesn’t introduce new functionality to an app’s runtime environment—apps in any architecture have always needed rules to specify how requests get from point A to point B. What’s different about a service mesh is that it takes the logic governing service-to-service communication out of individual services and abstracts it to a layer of infrastructure.

To do this, a service mesh is built into an app as an array of network proxies. Proxies are a familiar concept in enterprise IT—if you are accessing this webpage from a work computer, there’s a good chance you just used one:

1. As your request for this page went out, it was first received by your company’s web proxy…
2. After passing the proxy’s security measure, it was sent to the server that hosts this page…
3. Next, this page was returned to the proxy and again checked against its security measures…
4. And then it was finally sent from the proxy to you.

In a service mesh, requests are routed between microservices through proxies in their own infrastructure layer. For this reason, individual proxies that make up a service mesh are sometimes called “sidecars,” since they run alongside each service, rather than within them. Taken together, these “sidecar” proxies—decoupled from each service—form a mesh network.

Without a service mesh, each microservice needs to be coded with logic to govern service-to-service communication, which means developers are less focused on business goals. It also means communication failures are harder to diagnose because the logic that governs interservice communication is hidden within each service.




A service registry is used to keep track of the location and health of services, so a requesting service can be directed to a provider service in a reliable way. Working hand in hand with the service registry is the function of service discovery. Service discovery uses the service registry’s list of available services and instances of those services, and it directs requests to the appropriate instance based on pure load balancing or any other rule that has been configured.

Some service meshes provide automated testing facilities. This gives you the ability to simulate the failure or temporary unavailability of one or more services in your app, and to make sure the resiliency features that you designed will work to keep the app functional. Two functions that can help to provide this resiliency are circuit breakers and bulkheads. Open-source mesh functions can be used to solve many of the challenges of implementing microservices.

## Service registry
The service registry is a simple key-value pair data store, maintaining a current list of all working service instances and their locations. As each service instance starts, it will register itself with the service registry, either through its own client code or through a third-party registrar function.

Because the service registry is so critical to the implementation, it needs to be made highly available in some way.
